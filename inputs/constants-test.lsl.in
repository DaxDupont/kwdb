This script checks the values of the actual constants against those reported
by the database. In case of mismatch, an error is reported together with the
line number of the line that produced it. The function c() does the actual
check. Parameter is a strided list containing any number of pairs with this
structure:

  database value, actual value

Example:
  c([
  0,FALSE
  ,1,TRUE
  ,"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",NULL_KEY
  ,<0.0, 0.0, 0.0>,ZERO_VECTOR
  ]);

The variable "line" is initialized to the line where the LSL KEYWORDS hook is,
plus one, following the viewer's editor line numbering convention that the
first line is line 0, rather than the customary one where the first line is 1.
Errors are reported using a line number that follows that same convention.
